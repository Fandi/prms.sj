prms.js
=======

crappy attempt to implement [C# async/await](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh873191.aspx) using Javascript (or is it JavaScript?)

not to be confused with [CommonJS Promises](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A), the purpose of prms.js is not to chain the asynchronous processes, instead proces flow are continued if none are consuming the result from the previous asynchroonus process.

John: Bob, could you repair my television?

Bob: sure thing, but I need a wrench for that, and I don't bring me any wrench at the moment.

John: I'll get you one, in the mean time, could you clean my bike? I see you bring a mop there.

Bob: *sigh* all right.
